# _ga_measuremnet_id_cookie_reader

Each GA4 property attached to a web page will drop a cookie named "_ga_[measurement_id]", in addition to the standard _ga cookie.

This cookie contains useful information, such as session count. This script reads and dissects the _ga_&lt;measurement_id> cookie value into usable components.

Can be run in the browser console for initial testing.
